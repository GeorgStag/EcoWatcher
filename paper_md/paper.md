# Summary

In this paper, there are provided details for an open WebApp associated with global warming monitoring. The WebApp is built through Shiny package in R programming language and is running live in the link provided in the paper. Through the app is easy to produce and download Plots, Statistical Testing Results, Numeric Tables and Temperature maps for the monthly temperature of a variety of countries worldwide.

The latest decades Conspiracy Theories are gaining ground every day due to the ever-expanding web utilities and especially social media. This phenomenon could not leave unaffected the case of Global Warming. Simultaneously, the literacy level of daily people, especially in the topics of Statistics is improving, too. Through this app we aim to give access to anyone for quick easy to double check and share statistical results and visualisations for the phenomenon of Earth Temperature.

The results of the App are based on the Datasets described in the links below. The data can also be downloaded from the App, for verification purposes.
